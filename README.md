# Deep Weather Prediction Models

Welcome to the Deep Weather Prediction Models repository. This project aims to harness the power of deep learning to predict weather conditions accurately. It features two models: one for single-step predictions, which forecast the immediate next step, and another for multi-step predictions, which forecast several steps into the future. Additionally, this repository includes scripts for analyzing and visualizing the dataset, which consists of 20 years of comprehensive weather data.

## Features

- **Single-Step Prediction Model**: Predicts the next immediate weather condition using a time series analysis approach.
- **Multi-Step Prediction Model**: Forecasts weather conditions multiple steps ahead, enabling more long-term planning and analysis.
- **Data Analysis Scripts**: Tools to examine and understand the dataset through various statistical methods and visualizations.
- **Data Visualization Tools**: Scripts to generate graphs and charts that illustrate trends and patterns in the weather data over two decades.
